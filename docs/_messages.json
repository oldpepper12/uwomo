As the eldest son with a drunken Father and a useless Mother, Quentin feels the need to be the authoritarian figure within the family. This trait was present within him as early as his childhood, where the children were playing at the branch and Caddy insisted on swimming. Quentin, having the age advantage, attempts to stop her by threatening her with the fear of their parents by stating that \u201cYour mommer going to whip you for getting your dress wet.\u201d (Faulkner 17). Immediately, even at nine years old, Quentin insists on trying to fix the problems that the other have put upon themselves because he is the eldest and the most responsible. Although his parent\u2019s expectations surely play a part, it may also be a mental factor that Quentin feels the responsibility of being the authority figure over the other children due to his circumstances; born into a rich Compson family and the eldest child of four. Quentin continues this conversation with Caddy at the branch to express authority; he claims that he is older and that he goes to school (17). Although this is a classic line for children to use against their siblings and peers, it represents the fact that Quentin takes pride in being older and understands that his position in the family is important. In addition to being the eldest child and feeling the need to be the authoritative figure within the family, Quentin\u2019s morals and principles also include attempting to obsessively help women even when it is unnecessary because he believes that they are pure and require a man\u2019s help. This is so much so that he attempts to find a foreign girl her way back home, despite her not asking. He pulled the responsibility on himself; she is in the bread shop while Quentin happened to be strolling by.", "what a quentin thing to do", "he's in my english class", "yeah", "dammit quentin", "ill
